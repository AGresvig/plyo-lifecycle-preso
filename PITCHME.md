## Client Project Lifecycle
An overview - from client introduction to site launch

---

## The introduction

New business typically comes to us through one of the following channels

- Partners
- Existing project
- Word of mouth, relations

---

### Partners
- They have existing clients in need of Web services
- 3D Estate, Mobile First, CAP10 are the primary ones
- They send the client to us, and get a kickback (%) of the project fee (not recurring rev.)
- Our Mentor (provided by government granted [Innovasjon Norge mentor program](http://www.innovasjonnorge.no/en/start-page/our-services/start-ups/)) also falls into this category. UNION came this way

---

### Existing project
- People, usually industry specific, see our logo in the footer of existing sites, and get in touch.
- Neptune Properties has given us a lot of traffic this way
- Clients also sometimes recommend us to friends & partners

---

### Word of mouth, relations
- Friends, previous colleagues etc

---

## The sales pitch

After client introduction, the work of persuasion begins. Three components typically go into the complete sales cycle:

- Sales meeting
- Sales presentation
- Request for proposal & Final offer

---

### Sales meeting

- Usually starts with a meeting on client premises, where we get a chance to present Plyo at its best.
- Herman typically takes these meetings often together with a partner (Philip from 3D Estate).
- On high-profile projects (like Union), or if technical inquries may arise, Aksel will attend
- From the client side: chief of marketing and one or two other stakeholders are present in this meeting.
- Client present their needs

---

### Sales presentation

Herman makes a PDF presentation in XD:

- It looks very fancy
- It presents us like we're a big company with long experience, both with tech & industry
- Gives a rough suggestion of what we envision for the client
- Presents Plyo structure - team composition, former clients etc
- General "industry truths" (statistics)
- Very visual

---

### The proposal

- Based on our understanding of client needs, we present a high level document describing our vision
- Contains sitemap, some visuals (branding), strategy for customer conversion, and more
- Contains base price, addon prices if any, and running cost
- Based on this, we create a final proposal for the client

---

#### New features - development

- If the project involves new features/functionality (big projects almost always do), more thorough pricing efforts are made
- Herman conveys his vision
- Aksel interprets it into very basic functional requirements
- Aksel typiclaly provides guesstimate time-estimates of required dev-time
- If bigger stuff (large epics), the team (Vova, Andrey) are engaged to provide estimates
- This goes into our price calculation tool

---

### Final offer

- A final offer, including sitemap, project description, and cost breakdown is produced
- It takes form of a contract in OneFlow
- Client can sign this electronically, legally binding them to the purchase

---

## Project kickoff

After contract is signed, the sequence goes like this:

- Planning meeting with client
- Plyo internal planning meeting
- Work!

---

### Client planning meeting

- A meeting is held with the client to gather more information about project structure
- Here, we inform them of the timeline and sequence of tasks
- What we need from them when, and what they can expect from us, when
- Try to gather as much content and branding as possible, following this meeting

---

### Plyo internal planning

- Herman, Magnus, Aksel hold internal meeting mapping out needed tasks (high-level)
- Herman is typically involved with design, branding, and any new feature design
- Magnus is in charge of content (text, images)
- Timeline is established, Trello cards are created

---

#### Dev planning

- If necessary, Aksel at this point introduces the new feature (Epic) with the dev team
- Usual procedure of things: Epic break down, task estimation, docs writing.
- Dev all the things!

---

### Site setup

- Aksel usually creates the site, either using `copy` script, or Registration App
- Magnus & Herman immediately starts setting up sitemap, creating pags, nav items etc
- More advanced things are configured by Aksel: FeedTile, Blog, project template setup, team member setup ++
- Aksel creates logos, favicons, sets brandcolors etc
- Apartment Choosers if needed are set up by Aksel, content is prepared & uploaded by Inna

---

### New feature dev

- Usually, any Epics are in progress by dev team at this point in time
- Aksel follows up development of new features
- This happens in tandem with general site setup

---

## Project finalization

Typically:

- Preview link & feedback
- Polishing
- Go-live
- Post-launch improvements

---

### Preview & feedback
- A preview link is sent to client as soon as primary content is in place
- Client provides feedback, and the process iterates
- Projet is polished until client is happy

---

### Dev wrapup

Dev cycle goes in parallell, but often for big projects:
- Testing of new features (completed tasks)
- Migrations
- Set up new feature in Preview env
- Verify

---

### Go-live

- On decided date, at night time
- Aksel configures DNS on behalf of client
- Databases are swapped to bring preview DB content to prod (Andrey or Aksel)
- Things are verified in Staging env by Aksel
- `plyo apps swap`!

---

### Post-launch

- There is always feedback from client
- Sometimes on content but mostly on "feel and functionality"
- Also things "they forgot about"

---

### Project life continues

For as long as its live.. Client pays querterly fees for hosting, support and maintenance.
