# Client Project Lifecycle
An overview

## The introduction

New business typically comes to us through one of the following channels:

### Partners
- They have existing clients in need of Web services
- 3D Estate, Mobile First, CAP10 are the primary ones
- They send the client to us, and get a kickback (%) of the project fee (not recurring rev.)
- Our Mentor (provided by government granted [Innovasjon Norge mentor program](http://www.innovasjonnorge.no/en/start-page/our-services/start-ups/)) also falls into this category. UNION came this way

### Existing project
- People, usually industry specific, see our logo in the footer of existing sites, and get in touch.
- Neptune Properties has given us a lot of traffic this way
- Clients also sometimes recommend us to friends & partners

### Word of mouth, relations
- Friends, previous colleagues etc
